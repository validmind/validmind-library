    Analyzes the alignment between credit scores and predicted probabilities.

    ### Purpose

    The Score-Probability Alignment test evaluates how well credit scores align with
    predicted default probabilities. This helps validate score scaling, identify potential
    calibration issues, and ensure scores reflect risk appropriately.

    ### Test Mechanism

    The test:
    1. Groups scores into bins
    2. Calculates average predicted probability per bin
    3. Tests monotonicity of relationship
    4. Analyzes probability distribution within score bands

    ### Signs of High Risk

    - Non-monotonic relationship between scores and probabilities
    - Large probability variations within score bands
    - Unexpected probability jumps between adjacent bands
    - Poor alignment with expected odds-to-score relationship
    - Inconsistent probability patterns across score ranges
    - Clustering of probabilities at extreme values
    - Score bands with similar probability profiles
    - Unstable probability estimates in key decision bands

    ### Strengths

    - Direct validation of score-to-probability relationship
    - Identifies potential calibration issues
    - Supports score band validation
    - Helps understand model behavior
    - Useful for policy setting
    - Visual and numerical results
    - Easy to interpret
    - Supports regulatory documentation

    ### Limitations

    - Sensitive to bin selection
    - Requires sufficient data per bin
    - May mask within-bin variations
    - Point-in-time analysis only
    - Cannot detect all forms of miscalibration
    - Assumes scores should align with probabilities
    - May oversimplify complex relationships
    - Limited to binary outcomes
