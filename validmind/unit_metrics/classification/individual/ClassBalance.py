def ClassBalance(model: VMModel, dataset: VMDataset, **kwargs) -> List[float]:
    """Calculates the class balance score per row for a classification model.

    For each prediction, this returns how balanced the predicted class is in the
    training distribution. Lower scores indicate predictions on rare classes,
    higher scores indicate predictions on common classes. This helps understand
    if model errors are more likely on imbalanced classes.

    Args:
        model: The classification model to evaluate
        dataset: The dataset containing true labels and predictions
        **kwargs: Additional parameters (unused for compatibility)

    Returns:
        List[float]: Per-row class balance scores as a list of float values

    Note:
        Scores range from 0 to 0.5, where 0.5 indicates perfectly balanced classes
        and lower values indicate more imbalanced classes.
