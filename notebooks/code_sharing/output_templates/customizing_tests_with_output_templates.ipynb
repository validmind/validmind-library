    "ValidMind is a suite of tools for managing model risk, including risk associated with AI and statistical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You use the ValidMind Library to automate documentation and validation tests, and then use the ValidMind Platform to collaborate on model documentation. Together, these products simplify model risk management, facilitate compliance with regulations and institutional standards, and enhance collaboration between yourself and model validators.\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook assumes you have basic familiarity with Python, including an understanding of how functions work. If you are new to Python, you can still run the notebook but we recommend further familiarizing yourself with the language. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter errors due to missing modules in your Python environment, install the modules with `pip install`, and then re-run the notebook. For more help, refer to [Installing Python Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html).\n",

There, you can learn more about documenting models and running tests, as well as find code samples and our Python Library API reference.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Output Templates**: Customizable HTML templates that define the look and feel of the results produced by the ValidMind tests. They are written in HTML and use the Jinja2 templating language.\n",
    "- **Jinja2 Templating Language**: A powerful templating language for Python that allows you to embed expressions and control structures in your HTML templates.\n",
    "- **Customizing Tables**: Output templates allow you to customize the look and feel of the tables produced by the ValidMind tests. This includes things like adding or removing columns, changing the formatting or structure of the table, and adding entirely new tables to the results.\n",
    "- **Documentation Templates**: Documentation templates are covered in the quickstart notebook and are the base for all model documentation. They are written in YAML and define the entire structure and content of a model's documentation. Output templates are not part of the documentation template, but they are defined in and shared via a field in the documentation template."

    "### How documentation template work with output templates\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a section of the standard Binary Classification Documentation Template that comes pre-installed with the ValidMind Library. \n",
    "\n",
    "The top-level `model_evaluation` section contains a list of sub sections which contain content blocks. These blocks can be either editable text blocks or test-driven blocks where the `content_id` identifies the test within the ValidMind Library whose results will be displayed in that block. Now the key thing here is that each of these tests produces a specific output that is not directly editable from the ValidMind Platform. This is where output templates come in, both figuraively and literally. They can be added as an optional field in the content block and will use the raw test output data in an HTML template to produce a custom table that can be displayed in the documentation."
