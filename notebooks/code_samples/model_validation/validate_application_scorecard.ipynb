     "### Key concepts\n",
     "\n",
     "**Validation report**: A comprehensive and structured assessment of a model’s development and performance, focusing on verifying its integrity, appropriateness, and alignment with its intended use. It includes analyses of model assumptions, data quality, performance metrics, outcomes of testing procedures, and risk considerations. The validation report supports transparency, regulatory compliance, and informed decision-making by documenting the validator’s independent review and conclusions.\n",
     "\n",
     "**Validation report template**: Serves as a standardized framework for conducting and documenting model validation activities. It outlines the required sections, recommended analyses, and expected validation tests, ensuring consistency and completeness across validation reports. The template helps guide validators through a systematic review process while promoting comparability and traceability of validation outcomes.\n",
     "\n",
     "**Tests**: A function contained in the ValidMind Library, designed to run a specific quantitative test on the dataset or model. Tests are the building blocks of ValidMind, used to evaluate and document models and datasets.\n",
     "\n",
     "**Metrics**: A subset of tests that do not have thresholds. In the context of this notebook, metrics and tests can be thought of as interchangeable concepts.\n",
     "\n",
     "**Custom metrics**: Custom metrics are functions that you define to evaluate your model or dataset. These functions can be registered with the ValidMind Library to be used in the ValidMind Platform.\n",
     "\n",
     "**Inputs**: Objects to be evaluated and documented in the ValidMind Library. They can be any of the following:\n",
     "\n",
     "  - **model**: A single model that has been initialized in ValidMind with [`vm.init_model()`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind.html#init_model).\n",
     "  - **dataset**: Single dataset that has been initialized in ValidMind with [`vm.init_dataset()`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind.html#init_dataset).\n",
     "  - **models**: A list of ValidMind models - usually this is used when you want to compare multiple models in your custom metric.\n",
     "  - **datasets**: A list of ValidMind datasets - usually this is used when you want to compare multiple datasets in your custom metric. (Learn more: [Run tests with multiple datasets](https://docs.validmind.ai/notebooks/how_to/run_tests_that_require_multiple_datasets.html))\n",
     "\n",
     "**Parameters**: Additional arguments that can be passed when running a ValidMind test, used to pass additional information to a metric, customize its behavior, or provide additional context.\n",
     "\n",
     "**Outputs**: Custom metrics can return elements like tables or plots. Tables may be a list of dictionaries (each representing a row) or a pandas DataFrame. Plots may be matplotlib or plotly figures."
