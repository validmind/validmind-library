    "An *application scorecard model* is a type of statistical model used in credit scoring to evaluate the creditworthiness of potential borrowers by generating a score based on various characteristics of an applicant such as credit history, income, employment status, and other relevant financial data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - This score assists lenders in making informed decisions about whether to approve or reject loan applications, as well as in determining the terms of the loan, including interest rates and credit limits.\n",
    " - Effective validation of application scorecard models ensures that lenders can manage risk efficiently while maintaining a fast and transparent loan application process for applicants.\n",
