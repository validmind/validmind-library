    "A *challenger model* is an alternate model that attempt to outperform the champion model, ensuring that the best performing fit-for-purpose model is always considered for deployment. Challenger models also help avoid over-reliance on a single model, and allow testing of new features, algorithms, or data sources without disrupting the production lifecycle."
