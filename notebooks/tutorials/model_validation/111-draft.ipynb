    "These notebooks use an application scorecard model as an example, but the same principles shown here apply to other model types."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Model validation aims to independently assess the compliance of *champion models* created by model developers with regulatory guidance by conducting thorough testing and analysis, potentially including the use of challenger models to benchmark performance. Assessments, presented in the form of a validation report, typically include *model findings* and recommendations to address those issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "An *application scorecard model* is a type of statistical model used in credit scoring to evaluate the creditworthiness of potential borrowers by generating a score based on various characteristics of an applicant such as credit history, income, employment status, and other relevant financial data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - This score assists lenders in making informed decisions about whether to approve or reject loan applications, as well as in determining the terms of the loan, including interest rates and credit limits.\n",
    " - Effective validation of application scorecard models ensures that lenders can manage risk efficiently while maintaining a fast and transparent loan application process for applicants.\n",
