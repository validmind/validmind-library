    "# ValidMind for model validation â€” 114 Finalize testing and reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn how to use ValidMind for your end-to-end model validation process with our series of four introductory notebooks. In this last notebook, you'll configure and run some custom tests, then add test results and findings to your validation report.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we concluded in [113 Perform validation tests](113-perform_validation_tests.ipynb), our challenger random forest classification model was not a viable candidate for our use case. We'll finish up by comparing our champion application scorecard model against our remaining challenger logistic regression model, then use the ValidMind Platform to put together our validation report supplemented by our logged test results as evidence and findings."

    "- [ ] Learned how to enable custom context for test descriptions generated by ValidMind\n",
    "- [ ] Understood the basics of how to identify and run validation tests\n",
    "- [ ] Run data quality and model performance tests for your champion and challenger models, and logged the results of those tests to the ValidMind Platform\n",
