    "# ValidMind for model validation — 113 Perform model validation tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn how to use ValidMind for your end-to-end model validation process with our series of four introductory notebooks. In this third notebook, you'll identify relevant validation tests, run them, then add the test results to your validation report.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll become familiar with the tests available in ValidMind, as well as how to run them. Running tests during model validation is crucial to the effective challenge process, as we want to independently evaluate the evidence and assessments provided by the model development team.\n",
    "\n",
    "While running our tests, we'll focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensuring that data used for training and testing the model is of appropriate data quality\n",
    "- Ensuring that the raw data has been preprocessed appropriately and that the resulting feature engineered dataset reflects this\n",
    "- Comprehensive testing around model performance of both the champion ahd challenger models\n",
