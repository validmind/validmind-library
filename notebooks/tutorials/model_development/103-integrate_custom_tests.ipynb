    "A custom test is any function that takes a set of inputs and parameters as arguments and returns one or more outputs. The function can be as simple or as complex as you need it to be. It can use external libraries, make API calls, or do anything else that you can do in Python. The only requirement is that the function signature and return values can be \"understood\" and handled by the ValidMind Library. As such, custom tests offer added flexibility by extending the default tests provided by ValidMind, enabling you to document any type of model or use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, you will learn how to implement a custom `inline` test that calculates the confusion matrix for a binary classification model. You will see that the custom test function is just a regular Python function that can include and require any Python library as you see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: in the context of Jupyter notebooks, we will use the word `inline` to refer to functions (or code) defined in the same notebook where they are used (this one) and not in a separate file, as we will see later with test providers.\n"
